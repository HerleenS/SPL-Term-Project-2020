# SPL-Term-Project-2020
Working on GoLang programming.

Milestone 1-

To run the programs go to the individual folders and exectue them using command line with the syntax -
go run programname.go

The reason for seperate files for programs is that go can only have one main class in a single folder and we have made 3 main classes in different files here.
